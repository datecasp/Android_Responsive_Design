# Android_Responsive_Design

# *WIP project*

This repo shows shorts examples of the use of responsive design in Android

I will add more UI examples with different features.

+ Branch CL+FAB shows a constraint layout within some buttons sharing screen with a text view.

  I also added a Floating Action Button (fab) that can be moved by user within the screen boundaries
